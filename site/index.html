      Taylor Swift is considered to be one of the most influential artists in the world.
      So far, she has released 10 albums, dubbing each one a specific era (e.g. the Red era, the Speak Now era, etc.).
      Before the pandemic, she usually had a tour focused on the newest album released to celebrate them (e.g. the Reputation Stadium Tour, the 1989 World Tour, etc.).
      However, after she started the Lover tour, the brunt of the pandemic hit, and she had to cancel it.
      Since then, she has released three new albums (folklore, evermore, Midnights) and two new re-records (Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version)).
      Now, since the pandemic is considered less severe, she has decided to go on tour again, but instead of dedicating it to one album, she has decided to dedicate it to all ten of her eras, dubbing it the ERAS TOUR.
      The Eras Tour started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona and continued until August 26, 2023, Mexico City, where she would take a break until November 9, 2023 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then another break at November 26, 2023 until February 7th, 2024 where she would play in Tokyo, Japan and continue flying around the world until November 23, 2024, Toronto, Canada, where the Eras Tour is scheduled to conclude (for now).

    <p> Contrary to its reputation, The Eras Tour Concert tickets (at their original price) were considered rather affordable, ranging from $49 for the cheapest seats to $499 for VIP seats (before after-fees). However, this was during the pre-sale, where you could directly buy tickets instead of buying from resellers. Tickets were extremely hard to get. Perhaps, if you clicked on a ticket .1 seconds slower, you would not be able to get one. This was also mainly due to many resellers scrambling to get tickets as well. Resellers would buy tickets and sell them at exuberant prices, from $500-$7000, more than 10x their original values. Some seats even surpassed $30,000 in cities such as Las Vegas, East Rutherford, Arlington, and Glendale. Her last [full] world tour, the reputation stadium tour had much lower resell prices, with the average being $279. The average price of a resell Eras Tour ticket is $2,424, greater than 8x the last.</p>
