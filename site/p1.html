    <h2> Surprise Songs </h2>
    <p>
    To spice up the tour and celebrate some of her songs that she doesn’t play live often, Swift has decided to play two different songs of her choosing (not from the setlist) each night of her tour. These songs, officially the “Acoustic Set” and informally dubbed “Surprise Songs” by the swifties (Swift’s fans), are between the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) era and the Midnights era. The first one is typically played and sung by Swift on the guitar, while the second one is on the piano. These songs could range anywhere from her first album (Taylor Swift), to her latest (Midnights), to songs written for movies (Eyes Open, Safe & Sound, Carolina, Crazier, Sweeter than Fiction, I Don’t Wanna Live Forever, etc.), to mashups (Is It Over Now? x Out Of The Woods, etc.).

  <br> Usually, once a surprise song is played, she doesn’t play it again during the tour (unless she messes up during the song). However, she has repeated some songs she hasn’t messed up, such as You’re On Your Own, Kid (Midnights), Maroon (Midnights), and Our Song (Taylor Swift). Also, during the last leg of the 2023 tour, she announced that she would be resetting the surprise song list for the 2024 tour, making all already-played songs available again.

    <h2> Friendship Bracelets </h2>
    <p> Many swifties would make friendship bracelets before the tour and wear them to exchange with other swifties during the tour. The friendship bracelets would usually have letters alloting to acronyms to certain songs, such as WTNY (Welcome to New York), LWYMMD (Look What You Made Me Do), ATWTMVTVFTVSGAVRALPS (All Too Well (Ten Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault) (Sad Girl Autumn Version) (Recorded At Long Pond Studios)), etc., while others would have acronyms for lyrics spelled out, such as SYRMSIANDSATSBRLARCSYSMAEIIJIYWD (Say you'll remember me, standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe, red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again, even if it's just in your wildest dreams --Wildest Dreams).<br>
    Friendship bracelets may have originated from Swift recieving friendship bracelets during her Debut/Fearless era, and some people have been making them for concerts as well already, but it mainly blew up thanks to a lyric in You're On You're Own, Kid (Midnights), where Swift sings: "So make the friendship bracelets/ Take a moment and taste it/ You've got no reason to be afraid"</p>
    <h2> Chants/Fan Traditions</h2>
    <p> Some swifties would also scream chants during some parts of songs. Some of these chants have lasted for a while, while others have been invented during the duration of the tour. <br>
    Chants (in era order): <br>
    <br>
    Delicate (reputation): <br>
    We can't make/ any promises now, can we babe? / But you can make me a drink/
    [1, 2, 3, let's go, b-tch!]
    Dive bar.. <br>
    Don't Blame Me (reputation): <br>
    Every time you're, every time you're touching me/
    [Take me to church, Taylor!]
    Oh, Lord save me... <br>
    All Too Well (Ten Minute Version) (Red (Taylor's Version)): <br>
    If we had been closer in age maybe it would've been fine/
    [How did that make you feel, Taylor?]
    And that made me want to die/The idea... <br>
    Style (1989 (Taylor's Version)): <br>
    [What time is it, Taylor?]
    Midnight... <br>
    Bad Blood (1989 (Taylor's Version)): <br>
    Band-aids don't fix bullet holes/ You say sorry just for show/ If you live like that, you live with ghosts/
    [You forgive, you forget, but you never let it GO (Kendrick Lamar's Verse)]
    Band-aid's don't fix... <br>
    Anti-Hero (Midnights): <br>
    Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?/
    [Taylor you'll be fine...]
    I wake up...<br>
    Bejeweled (Midnights): <br>
    And by the way/
    [Where are you going, Taylor?]
    I'm going out tonight/
    [Yes you are!]
    Best believe... <br>
<br>
    Fan Traditions (traditions during songs that aren't chants):<br>
    You Need To Calm Down (Lover):<br>
    Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh/ *Let me see your hands (Swift says this, not part of actual song)*
    [Wave hand in the air on beat] You need to calm down...<br>
    Fearless (Fearless (Taylor's Version)): <br>
    When Swift makes a heart with her hands and holds it above her head, do that as well. <br>
    You Belong With Me (Fearless (Taylor's Version)): <br>
    Oh, I remember you driving to my house/ In the middle of the night/ I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry/<br>
    [*Clap Twice*]
    I know your favorite songs.. <br>
    Long Live (Speak Now (Taylor's Version)): <br>
    I had the time of my life [*Point at Taylor*] with you/ Long, long live... <br>
    marjorie (evermore): <br>
    Turning on their phone flashlights and lighting up the stadium in honor of Marjorie (Swift's grandmother).
    We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Red (Taylor's Version)):<br>
    We break up/ You call me/ [*Point at Taylor*] I love you/... <br>

    <br>
    Note: Many of these chants are not as widespread as some. The most popular/well-known chants are the Delicate chant, the Bad Blood chant, the You Need To Calm Down wave, the Fearless heart, the You Belong With Me clap, and the Long Live point.
