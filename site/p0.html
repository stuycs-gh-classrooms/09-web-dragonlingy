    <h2> Setlist </h2>
    <p>
    The basic structure of the Eras Tour is that she will play some songs from each era/album, then undergo a costume change and transition to the next.
    Each era also has a color associated with it, with Debut (Taylor Swift) being green, Fearless (Taylor's Version) being yellow, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) being purple, Red (Taylor's Version) being red, 1989 (Taylor's Version) being light blue, reputation being black, Lover being pink, folklore being gray, evermore being brown, and Midnights being dark blue/blue.
    Many people believe Lover is first as it is the first album that she actually owns.
    The order of albums played are as followed:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Lover </li>
<li>Fearless (Taylor’s Version)</li>
<li>evermore</li>
<li>reputation</li>
<li>Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)</li>
<li>Red (Taylor’s Version)</li>
<li>folklore</li>
<li>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</li>
<li>Acoustic Set [see SURPRISE SONGS]</li>
<li>Midnights</li>
</ul>
<p> Before the actual concert starts, usually there will be an opening act (Check Miscalleneous Fun Facts (and Openers)). After the opening act, she will play the well-known Eras Tour intro, featuring songs/words from/about each era: <br>
