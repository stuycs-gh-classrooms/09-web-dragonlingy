     We gather here, we line up <br>
    Weepin' in a sunlit room, and <br>
    If I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes too <br>
    Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe <br>
    All the hell you gave me? <br>
    'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you <br>
    'Til my dying day <br>
    I didn't have it in myself to go with grace <br>
    And you're the hero flying around, saving face <br>
    And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake? <br>
    Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br>
    Look at how my tears ricochet <br>
    We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean <br>
    Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring <br>
    You know I didn't want to have to haunt you <br>
    But what a ghostly scene <br>
    You wear the same jewels that I gave you <br>
    As you bury me <br>
    I didn't have it in myself to go with grace <br>
    'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave <br>
    And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake? <br>
    Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br>
    Look at how my tears ricochet <br>
    And I can go anywhere I want<br>
    Anywhere I want, just not home<br>
    And you can aim for my heart, go for blood<br>
    But you would still miss me in your bones<br>
    And I still talk to you (when I'm screaming at the sky)<br>
    And when you can't sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies)<br>
    I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
    And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves<br>
    You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same<br>
    Cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
    You turned into your worst fears<br>
    And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain<br>
    Crossing out the good years<br>
    And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed<br>
    Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
