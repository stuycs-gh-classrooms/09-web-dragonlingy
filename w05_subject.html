    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Taylor Swift is considered to be one of the most influential artists in the world.
      So far, she has released 10 albums, dubbing each one a specific era (e.g. the Red era, the Speak Now era, etc.). 
      Before the pandemic, she usually had a tour focused on the newest album released to celebrate them (e.g. the Reputation Stadium Tour, the 1989 World Tour, etc.).
      However, after she started the Lover tour, the brunt of the pandemic hit, and she had to cancel it.
      Since then, she has released three new albums (folklore, evermore, Midnights) and two new re-records (Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version)).
      Now, since the pandemic is considered less severe, she has decided to go on tour again, but instead of dedicating it to one album, she has decided to dedicate it to all ten of her eras, dubbing it the ERAS TOUR.
      The Eras Tour started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona and continued until August 26, Mexico City, where she would take a break until November 9 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then another break at November 26 until February 7th, where she would play in Tokyo, Japan and continue flying around the world until November 23, Toronto, Canada, where the Eras Tour is scheduled to conclude (for now).
