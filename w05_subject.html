    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Taylor Swift is considered to be one of the most influential artists in the world.
      So far, she has released 10 albums, dubbing each one a specific era (e.g. the Red era, the Speak Now era, etc.). 
      Before the pandemic, she usually had a tour focused on the newest album released to celebrate them (e.g. the Reputation Stadium Tour, the 1989 World Tour, etc.).
      However, after she started the Lover tour, the brunt of the pandemic hit, and she had to cancel it.
      Since then, she has released three new albums (folklore, evermore, Midnights) and two new re-records (Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version)).
      Now, since the pandemic is considered less severe, she has decided to go on tour again, but instead of dedicating it to one album, she has decided to dedicate it to all ten of her eras, dubbing it the ERAS TOUR.
      The Eras Tour started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona and continued until August 26, Mexico City, where she would take a break until November 9 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then another break at November 26 until February 7th, where she would play in Tokyo, Japan and continue flying around the world until November 23, Toronto, Canada, where the Eras Tour is scheduled to conclude (for now).

	<h2>Surprise Songs</h2>
	<p>
  To spice up the tour and celebrate some of her songs that she doesn’t play live often, Swift has decided to play two different songs of her choosing (not from the setlist) each night of her tour. These songs, officially the “Acoustic Set” and informally dubbed “Surprise Songs” by the swifties (Swift’s fans), are between the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) era and the Midnights era. The first one is typically played and sung by Swift on the guitar, while the second one is on the piano. These songs could range anywhere from her first album (Taylor Swift), to her latest (Midnights), to songs written for movies (Eyes Open, Safe & Sound, Carolina, Crazier, Sweeter than Fiction, I Don’t Wanna Live Forever, etc.), to mashups (Is It Over Now? x Out Of The Woods, etc.). 

<br> Usually, once a surprise song is played, she doesn’t play it again during the tour (unless she messes up during the song). However, she has repeated some songs she hasn’t messed up, such as You’re On Your Own, Kid (Midnights), Maroon (Midnights), and Our Song (Taylor Swift). Also, during the last leg of the 2023 tour, she announced that she would be resetting the surprise song list for the 2024 tour, making all already-played songs available again.
